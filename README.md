ArcadeShooter
=============

2D Game using Microsoft XNA.

- WASD to Move
- Left Click to fire bullets
- Kill enemies to earn score
- Kill all enemies to progress to next level

Currently there are three levels, but it's easy to add more.
Simply add a new Level builder method in the level class to instantiate more enemies.

This project was created for Game Engines, Fall of 2014. While I have finished the game
in this format, I will likely be porting it to Unity fairly soon.
